Google’s share of the search ad market is supposed to grow to more than 80 percent by 2019, according to research firm eMarketer.

While the company’s dominance of the search ad market is to be expected, its growing market share is bad news for competing companies, including Microsoft, Yelp and AOL.

Last year, Google held 75.8 percent of the search ad market, bringing in $24.6 billion in revenue from search ads. That’s expected to grow to $36.62 billion in revenue, or 80.2 percent of the market, in 2019.

That all comes at the expense of Microsoft, Yelp and Verizon-owned AOL, which are expected to lose market share down to 6.6 percent, 5.8 percent and 1.1 percent of search ad spending, respectively.

Monica Peart, an analyst with eMarketer, said in a statement that Google has mobile search to thank for the growth.

“Google and mobile search as a whole will continue to benefit from this behavioral shift,” she said.
