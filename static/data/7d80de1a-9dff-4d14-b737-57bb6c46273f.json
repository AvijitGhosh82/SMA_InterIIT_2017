The forward indicator discouraged investors, selling of the stock now down about 5% since the prior to the Q3 report posted on March 21. (See also: Nike Posts Mixed Q3, Stock Falls.)\n\nFutures and Revenues Will Remain Less Correlated\n\nAnalysts see the next fiscal year as a \u201crebase year\u201d while Nike shifts from wholesale to building out its direct-to-consumer infrastructure and ecommerce presence, reports Business Insider. This journey will be a rough one for the athletic apparel and footwear manufacturer, indicates UBS analysts in a recent research note to clients, which stated \u201cit\u2019s going to get darker before the dawn.\u201d However, UBS says Nike\u2019s new focus away from wholesale with traditional retail clients will make metrics such as futures less of a key indicator. \u201cWe think there\u2019s truth to comments that futures and revenues will remain less correlated as [Nike] rolls out product with lead-time of less than 3 months,\" said UBS.\n\nAnalysts expect the overall retail climate to act as a headwind as Nike evolves its business. Data from NPD Group shows total athletic footwear sales down 14% year over year (YOY) in February, including declines in running and classics categories which have been relatively strong in the past. At the further expense of Nike\u2019s sales is the revival of Adidas AG (ADDYY) in the U.S. market, as the German-based company saw its shares hit a record high on a fresh quarterly earnings beat.\n\nDespite industry headwinds and heightened competitive pressure, analysts remain optimistic on prospects for Nike\u2019s turnaround in the next couple of quarters. The Beaverton, Ore.-based company will likely double down on innovation, speed up product to market time, and improve its distribution outside traditional retailers in order to remain at the head of the global industry.
