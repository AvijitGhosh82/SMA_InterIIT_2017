I. du Pont de Nemours and Company (NYSE:DD) has been on a run \u2014 rising 7.07 percent in just three months. It looks like traders are happy with the stock. On the other side, analysts now consider E. I. du Pont de Nemours and Company a neutral, and a technical analysis of the stock is setting somewhat neutral outlook for now.\n\nLet\u2019s talk about the gap between analyst price targets for the next 12 months and E. I. du Pont de Nemours and Company (DD)\u2018s current share price. Normally this spread should be in positive territory, indicating that analysts expect an investment\u2019s value to increase over time. So is with E. I. du Pont de Nemours and Company. The median target of analyst views collected by Yahoo Finance was as much as $5.24 below DD\u2019s recent stock price. That\u2019s the optimistic view from Wall Street.\n\nThe stock has actually made strong gains in the past year, as the company has gathered a 26.24% return in the past twelve months. But even with this move, there is still plenty of room for the company to come back from a longer term perspective, and especially if we look to recent lows for the company as well.\n\nThe company\u2019s share price is down -2.63% from previous highs of around $81.86 per share on March 20, 2017. On the bright side, the company\u2019s share price has been on the rebound, up more than 39.07% since hitting lows of $61.12 on July 06, 2016.\n\nFinally, from a technical perspective, there\u2019s a strong possibility that the stock could enter into a new bull market after finding strong support between $78.11 and $78.94. In terms of pullbacks, $81.21 level is the first resistance point. Technical analysis can help recognize key technical price levels in the stock. Investors can use these support and resistance levels to refine their entries and exits from stocks.\n\nE. I. du Pont de Nemours and Company (NYSE:DD) price is pointing towards neither exit nor entry barriers, according to a technical analysis tool called the Relative Strength Index (RSI). Last session E. I. du Pont de Nemours and Company RSI was seen at 53.79. RSI measures the speed and change of a stock price to warn investors when a stock\u2019s momentum has carried it too far. An RSI reading above 80 indicates that a stock is overbought while anything below 20 is oversold.\n\nWith these kinds of figures it is worthy to note that E. I. du Pont de Nemours and Company (DD) has been put into a neutral territory, but there are few other spots to consider. The Stochastic %K for DD is 67.81. Stochastics is a momentum indicator that uses basic support and resistance levels and integrates with the trend to give accurate buy or sell signals to traders. For stochastics, readings below 20 are considered oversold and you would only take buy signals if the indicator is below that level. A value of 80 is considered overbought and sell signals occurring below that level would be ignored. This leads to longer trades and should result in fewer losses.\u201d)\n\n14-day Williams %R for E. I. du Pont de Nemours and Company (NYSE:DD) moved to around 75. The interpretation of Williams %R is very similar to that of the stochastic oscillator, except that the stochastic oscillator has internal smoothing. The oscillator ranges from 0 to -100. No matter how fast a security advances or declines, Williams %R will always fluctuate within this range. Overbought and oversold levels can be used to identify unsustainable price extremes. Simply put, readings in the range of 80% to 100% indicate that the security is oversold while readings in the 0% to 20% range suggest it is overbought.</p>"}}, {"media": {"url": "", "caption": "Score Analyse", "credit": "<a href = \"http://news.google.com/news/url?sa=T&ct2=us&fd=S&url=http://www.senecaglobe.com/legging-run-stock-in-volatile-measures-ensco-plc-nyseesv-e-i-du-pont-de-nemours-and-company-nysedd/379523/&cid=52779429588369&ei=4g3WWJnNN8bkugSH6oKYBQ&usg=AFQjCNGXf4ToopuisHQZt-FCZMj2tuGRdQ\">Seneca Globe</a>"}, "start_date": {"hour": 12, "month": 3, "second": 0, "year": 2017, "day": 22, "minute": 0}, "end_date": {}, "text": {"headline": "\nLegging Run Stock in Volatile Measures- Ensco plc (NYSE:ESV), EI du Pont de\u00a0...\n", "text": "<p>Ensco plc (NYSE:ESV) [Trend Analysis] considering as most desiring stocks in active trading lead, shares inched down after opening to traded at $8.46 with volume of 8.77 Million shares.

I. du Pont de Nemours and Company (DD), and see some interesting trends in the stock\u2019s behavior of late. They say the \u201csoul\u201d of a stock is best known by an examination of its behavior on the tape. With that in mind, consider how this stock has been acting as a clue to where it may be headed going forward.\n\nDD has been trading in a bearish trend, based on the relative levels of its 50-day and 200-day simple moving averages. This suggests that the broad sum of capital flow in the stock has been generally negative over the recent period. In terms of the relative level of interest afforded this stock among active participants in the market, relative volume measures have been strong, indicating enthusiasm for the name by traders, investors, and money managers during the past month of action. This suggests something of the significance of other current technical measures as well.\n\nFor market timers, it\u2019s also important to take measure of the relative level of recent lift or pressure in the stock is it overbought or oversold? For that, we turn to RSI and stochastic measures. The 14-day RSI stands at 52.05%. That shows that the stock, according to a traditional interpretation and usage of the RSI indicator, is not particularly predisposed to a reactive price movement based on this measure If we look at the stochastic measure, the raw data over the stock\u2019s last month of action shows a score of 81.13%. Based on a raw data interpretation, the stock is relatively overbought from this perspective.\n\nIt should be noted that the overall volatility in the stock is worth gauging as well. In recent action, DD has made a move of +2.58 over the past month. Over the trailing year, the stock is outperforming the S&P 500 by 6.99%, and it\u2019s gotten there by action that has been more volatile on a day-to-day basis than most other stocks on the exchange. The stock\u2019s recent movement has come on a historical volatility score of 17.85%, which represents the standard deviation of returns of a theoretical long position from a mean price during that period. On a daily basis over the past month, the average true range of the stock, as expressed in percentage terms, is 1.4%. That should give you a pretty good sense of the level of risk implied in a short-term trading approach in the stock with a stop-loss in place.\n\nAs it stands at present, the stock might find important action at key Fibonacci levels. Fibonacci levels are used by major Wall Street firm technical desks. The math is drawn from the Fibonacci series that defines growth systems by an interval increase characterized by steps divisible by the \u201cgolden ratio\u201d of 61.8%. In this case, the critical 38.2% level drawn off the 52-weeklow of $60.16 sits at $68.45. DD also has additional support below at the stock\u2019s 200-day simple moving average, which sits at $71.29.</p>"}}]}
