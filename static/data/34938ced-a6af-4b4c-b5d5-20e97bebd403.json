(GS) And Its Technical Chart Creates A\u00a0...\n", "text": "<p>The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (GS) has created a compelling message for traders in the most recent trading. That message has grown stronger as the technical chart setup has developed into a more composite picture for the stock. This is the breakdown as we see it. The technical chart doesn\u2019t get the respect it deserves and it\u2019s a shame, really. So many fortunes have been built upon an understanding, and use of a technical chart that it is almost unfathomable that some traders would ignore its power.\n\nThe 50 and 200 SMAs for GS have created a marked trend which is now helping traders to make solid decisions regarding the stock. It\u2019s a trend that is now unmistakable. Based on the trend levels presented by both indicators, the overall sentiment towards GS is best described as bullish. This trend has created a unified opinion across the trading floor and it is clear that the overall outlook for the stock is now established as positive. But it\u2019s not just the outlook that\u2019s being affected for the stock. Thanks to the consolidated opinion on GS, activity has also seen a pronounced trend. Under current sentiments the volume activity and subsequent trend has created a weak outlook from buyers and sellers. Sentiments have a tendency to either weaken or strengthen as other technical factors begin to influence overall outlook. It\u2019s interesting to see how things are playing out for GS. It is unsurprising in the case of GS, that the current trend has created some indifference among traders regarding the stock. In terms of consistency, it is clear that both the 50 and 200 SMAs have done their job in bring traders the overall trend-picture currently being seen for GS.\n\nThere is of course more to the tale than just what the SMAs have presented. For those added details, we can take a look at the Relative strength indicator (RSI) and Stochastic measures, both of which give deeper insights into the overall sentiment of buyers and sellers. SMAs will tell alert you to price direction, but when it comes to judging what buyers and sellers are doing, few indicators are better than RSI and the Stochastic. It as this level of technical data that a trader can determine whether a stock is currently overbought is oversold. The current picture for GS is of course very telling based on these two additional measures. Based on current readings, GS\u2019s 14-day RSI is 28.41%. Taken on the standard scale of measurement for RSI, this suggests that GS is currently oversold, suggesting that the stock may have hit a floor and could potentially see an uptick. The stochastic reading offers another solid measure of whether the stock is either overbought, or oversold. In the case of GS, Stochastic readings gathered over the last 30 days have created a score of 2.07%. This suggests GS is oversold at current levels.\n\nSMAs and RSI, though not mythological narrations of a stock\u2019s power or stranding, can sometimes provide the clarity needed to make decisions. But those decisions might be half-formed due to a lacking of all the pertinent information. This is where broadening the analysis can really help. By this point in the analysis of GS, it is clear that other technical indicators are saying essentially the same things. Specifically the -18.76 has birthed a negative overall sentiment when measured over the previous 30 days or so of trading. Over the longer-term GS has outperform the S&P 500 by 34.61. This has, unsurprisingly, created higher volatility levels when compared with similar stocks of the same grade and class. Historical volatility is no less consistent. The historical volatility picture for GS is shown in the reading of 17.47%. GS has clearly shown its full hand by the overall input of these technical indicators. But there is one final measure that when added to the already rich mix, shows in full color what GS is doing. The indicator is the Average True Range, and based on the current 1.74 reading, GS is certainly worth paying attention to.\n\nGS couldn\u2019t be clearer in terms of the kind of action required in light of the picture shown by its technical indicators.</p>"}}, {"media": {"url": "", "caption": "Score Analyse", "credit": "<a href = \"http://news.google.com/news/url?sa=T&ct2=us&fd=S&url=http://petroglobalnews24.com/2017-03-22-polymetal-international-plc-poly-receives-buy-rating-from-goldman-sachs-group-inc/&cid=52779434262984&ei=7vLVWNibCYSougTSg6moCw&usg=AFQjCNGcxUB7w-9I9X07RT1DNX6it8fP8w\">Petro Global News 24</a>"}, "start_date": {"hour": 12, "month": 3, "second": 0, "year": 2017, "day": 22, "minute": 0}, "end_date": {}, "text": {"headline": "\nThe Polymetal International PLC (POLY) Receives Buy Rating from Goldman Sachs\u00a0...\n", "text": "<p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc reiterated their buy rating on shares of Polymetal International PLC (LON:POLY) in a report released on Thursday morning.

(GS) : Checking the\u00a0Chart\n", "text": "<p>We have gathered the technical data on The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (GS), and see some interesting trends in the stock\u2019s behavior of late. In the end, it\u2019s all about what a stock does that matters. In the case of this particular stock, the chart tells quite a story at present.\n\nGS has been trading in a bearish trend, based on the relative levels of its 50-day and 200-day simple moving averages. This suggests that the broad sum of capital flow in the stock has been generally negative over the recent period. In terms of the relative level of interest afforded this stock among active participants in the market, relative volume measures have been weak, indicating apathy for the name by traders, investors, and money managers during the past month of action. This suggests something of the significance of other current technical measures as well.\n\nFor market timers, it\u2019s also important to take measure of the relative level of recent lift or pressure in the stock is it overbought or oversold? For that, we turn to RSI and stochastic measures. The 14-day RSI stands at 28.41%. That shows that the stock, according to a traditional interpretation and usage of the RSI indicator, is becoming oversold or undervalued, and therefore may be ready for a trend change or corrective price reversal to the upside If we look at the stochastic measure, the raw data over the stock\u2019s last month of action shows a score of 2.07%. Based on a raw data interpretation, this perspective doesn\u2019t suggest either an overbought or oversold condition.\n\nAs professionals know, risk is best understood through a measure of volatility in an investment vehicle. In recent action, GS has made a move of -18.76 over the past month. Over the trailing year, the stock is outperforming the S&P 500 by 32.55%, and it\u2019s gotten there by action that has been more volatile on a day-to-day basis than most other stocks on the exchange. The stock\u2019s recent movement has come on a historical volatility score of 17.47%, which represents the standard deviation of returns of a theoretical long position from a mean price during that period. On a daily basis over the past month, the average true range of the stock, as expressed in percentage terms, is 1.7%. That should give you a pretty good sense of the level of risk implied in a short-term trading approach in the stock with a stop-loss in place.\n\nAs it stands at present, the stock might find important action at key Fibonacci levels. Fibonacci levels are used by major Wall Street firm technical desks. The math is drawn from the Fibonacci series that defines growth systems by an interval increase characterized by steps divisible by the \u201cgolden ratio\u201d of 61.8%. In this case, the critical 38.2% level drawn off the 52-weeklow of $136.88 sits at $182.06. GS also has additional support below at the stock\u2019s 200-day simple moving average, which sits at $195.75.</p>"}}, {"media": {"url": "", "caption": "Score Analyse", "credit": "<a href = \"http://news.google.com/news/url?sa=T&ct2=us&fd=S&url=https://www.thecerbatgem.com/2017/03/22/novartis-ag-nvs-receives-neutral-rating-from-goldman-sachs-group-inc.html&cid=52779426820045&ei=7vLVWNibCYSougTSg6moCw&usg=AFQjCNGHtuanf0D2bMzWHbI2iRvMkw3ztw\">The Cerbat Gem</a>"}, "start_date": {"hour": 12, "month": 3, "second": 0, "year": 2017, "day": 22, "minute": 0}, "end_date": {}, "text": {"headline": "\nNovartis AG (NVS) Receives Neutral Rating from Goldman Sachs Group\u00a0Inc\n", "text": "<p>Novartis AG (NYSE:NVS)\u2018s stock had its \u201cneutral\u201d rating reaffirmed by analysts at Goldman Sachs Group Inc in a report issued on Wednesday.\n\nA number of other brokerages have also recently commented on NVS.

Pax withdrew the proposals after all five agreed to take steps to address pay inequities, though none committed to the specific requests to make public the data or to close the gaps.\n\n\u201cThis is a process,\u201d said Heather Smith, lead sustainability research analyst at Portsmouth, New Hampshire-based Pax. \u201cWe don\u2019t expect our work to stop here. We will be continuing our conversations with these and other companies.\u201d\n\nFollowing Pax\u2019s proposals, three of the companies -- Bank of New York Mellon Corp., Verizon Communications Inc. and Qualcomm Inc. -- released statements outlining their commitments to pay parity and explaining how they will monitor it. Goldman Sachs Group Inc. agreed to enhance pay equity disclosures in a report this spring, Smith said. Fletcher Cook, a spokesman for AT&T, said the company had signed the White House Equal Pay Pledge last year, reinforcing \u201cwhat we already deliver to our employees: equal pay for comparable work, experience and performance.\u201d\n\nOther finance companies are resisting similar pressure from Boston-based Arjuna Capital. At 2017 annual meetings, shareholders at Wells Fargo & Co., Citigroup Inc., American Express Co. and Bank of America Corp. will vote on measures asking the companies to issue reports examining gender-pay gaps and their efforts to ensure parity.\n\nAll four have advised investors to reject the proposals, arguing that they already have strong records on hiring, paying and promoting women. None make public any examination of gender-pay gaps or efforts to ensure pay parity, according to Natasha Lamb, managing director at Arjuna.\n\nThe most important business stories of the day. Get Bloomberg's daily newsletter.\n\nLamb said the companies she engaged with had offered similar responses to those Pax received, but Arjuna didn\u2019t withdraw its proposals. \u201cIt is not sufficient,\u201d she said. \u201cWe expect the same level of reporting as the tech companies gave in 2016. That means reporting the percentage gap and committing to close it.\u201d Last year, Arjuna made equal pay proposals at nine tech companies, seven of which -- including Intel Corp. and Apple Inc. -- agreed to make the data public and close the gaps.\n\nThe gender-pay gap has become an important metric for investors and others who are concerned about increasing opportunity for women in finance. While women represent about half of the workforce of the 23 banks with market capitalization of greater than $25 billion, they make up only about 21 percent of their executive ranks, according to Bloomberg data.\n\nThe finance industry also has one of the largest pay disparities, according to a survey by job site Glassdoor.com. Men who work at financial services firms on average earn 6.4 percent more than women, after controlling for job title and responsibilities. The gap at technology companies, for example, is 5.9 percent.</p>"}}, {"media": {"url": "", "caption": "Score Analyse", "credit": "<a href = \"http://news.google.com/news/url?sa=T&ct2=us&fd=S&url=http://petroglobalnews24.com/2017-03-22-shire-plcs-shpg-focus-list-rating-reaffirmed-at-goldman-sachs-group-inc/&cid=52779430629388&ei=7vLVWNibCYSougTSg6moCw&usg=AFQjCNE9ze4rfoWKYC5NpfUs51Ox0oNEEQ\">Petro Global News 24</a>"}, "start_date": {"hour": 12, "month": 3, "second": 0, "year": 2017, "day": 22, "minute": 0}, "end_date": {}, "text": {"headline": "\nShire PLC's (SHPG) \u201cFocus List\u201d Rating Reaffirmed at Goldman Sachs Group\u00a0Inc\n", "text": "<p>Shire PLC (NASDAQ:SHPG)\u2018s stock had its \u201cfocus list\u201d rating reissued by research analysts at Goldman Sachs Group Inc in a research note issued on Tuesday.\n\nA number of other research analysts have also weighed in on the company.
