Welcome to Industry Focus, the podcast that dives into a different sector of the stock market every day. You're listening to the Financials edition, taped today on Monday, March 13, 2017. My name is Gaby Lapera, and joining me on the phone is Dylan Lewis, the Industry Focus: Tech host. Hey!\n\nDylan Lewis: How's it going, Gaby?\n\nLapera: Good, how about you?\n\nLewis: Doing OK. I'm calling you, more specifically, from my hotel room in Austin on a landline. I can't remember the last time I used a landline phone.\n\nLapera: Me neither, actually. [laughs] I know that you're in Austin, Texas. You're there for South by Southwest. Can you talk a little bit about what that is, for our listeners who aren't as familiar?\n\nLewis: Yeah. South by Southwest is an annual conference. You have the mix of music, art, and emerging tech, which is very much of the culture in Austin. We go every year, this is my second year going with the Fool, and we check out what's going on, what are some of the nascent technologies that companies are spending some time investing in, putting some big resources behind, and some things that might be changing the landscape of a lot of the industries that we focus on every day.\n\nLapera: Awesome. Listeners, get used to hearing Dylan. I hope you like him. I know I do. Because, the shows this week are going to be a little bit different. He's going to be joining each one and talking about how tech is seeping into all of our sectors, and what the maybe next big thing is in each sector. Which I'm pretty excited about.\n\nLewis: Yeah, it'll be less of an investing-focused week, not so much in the nuts and bolts of, say, accounting. A little bit more talking about emerging tech. Thankfully, premium analyst Simon Erickson is also going to hop on the podcast. He's going to handle the Healthcare episode and the Energy and Industrials show on Thursday. So you won't have to hear my voice too much.\n\nLapera: Oh. I forgot about Simon. That will be really good too. And I'm sure you're breathing a sigh of relief, because I know healthcare isn't exactly your thing. [laughs]\n\nLewis: No. Simon has a lot more interesting things to say about healthcare than I do.\n\nLapera: That's OK. I know you have plenty of interesting things to say about financials, so I'm glad to have you on my show. Today's topic is about disruption in the payments space. You attended a session called \"Payments Gone Viral: The Rise Of Social Commerce.\" Can you tell us a little bit about the general premise, and tell us about who was there?\n\nLewis: Yeah. The two folks that I was really interested in on the panel were Hans Morris, who is someone who is a long-term member of the payments space, he's currently a VC, he's at Nyca Partners, he has extensive experience working in payments at Visa and [Citigroup]. And also, Kahina Van Dyke, who is at Facebook, she works in the consumer financials services and payments and commerce side of their business, which I think a lot of people don't even realize exists. It was definitely really interesting to hear the two of them weigh in on what is going on with social platforms and payments, and how that relates to some of the industry stalwarts like the payment processors, the credit card companies, and the banks.\n\nLapera: Yeah. What is social commerce?\n\nLewis: It's basically layering on a lot of the financial services or money exchanging that we're used to doing with banks, on platforms that we tend to think of more for social. So, Messenger allows for peer-to-peer --\n\nLapera: That's Facebook Messenger, folks, just in case you weren't sure which one. AOL instant messenger, etc. [laughs]\n\nLewis: Sorry, I realize I need to be a little bit less insider tech. That's great clarification, sorry about that. But, Facebook Messenger allows for peer-to-peer processing of payments. They're not doing the processing, though the optics for a user might be. They're really just enabling people to transfer money back and forth, and leaning on the legacy systems. That was really what a lot of this talk was about. I think one of the things really early on that set the tone for me was Hans said, \"If you're thinking about getting into the payments space, whether you are a big tech company or a new fresh starter looking to disrupt the space, don't compete with other forms of electronic payments. Compete with cash or with transactions that just don't happen.\" And his thought here is, there's so much going on, there's so much money that's been invested in the infrastructure to support payment processing. You're not going to unseat those people. What you are going to do is collect a decent amount of the market, and a meaningful market share, if you're able to replace cash and take what would be offline transactions digital. Or, if you're able to enable transactions that wouldn't happen. So, making it easier when people might not have money, or making a more streamlined, a little bit less friction type process that eliminates some of the barriers for transactions that don't happen now.\n\nLapera: Yeah, definitely. That's really interesting, you said it's brutally tough to compete with the legacy payment processors. Of course, he's talking about companies like Visa or Mastercard or even American Express. These companies have giant moats. They have these crazy international systems. The thing about Visa and Mastercard is the more users they have, the more merchants they're going to have, because the merchants have an interest in providing a service that lets people give them money easier. Of course, that creates a self-fulfilling cycle, where the more merchants who have Visa, the more customers who have Visa.\n\nLewis: In tech, to bring it back around and use a tech term, we call that the network effect. It's no different than the idea that Facebook as a platform is more valuable because there are more users on Facebook. So, with every incremental user -- if you only have four friends on Facebook, then how valuable is it for you to be on there? If you have 1,000 friends on Facebook, and it's the way you connect with people, and that's how you plan, then it becomes a much more valuable and compelling value proposition for potential users. So, the same mechanics at play.\n\nLapera: Definitely. And one thing I want listeners to think about is, when was the last time you went into a merchant and you were like, \"Oh no, they don't take whatever card I have in my wallet?\" I bet you can't remember a time, unless they just didn't accept cards at all.\n\nLewis: Just those hip bars in D.C. that only collect cash.\n\nLapera: [laughs] Those are the most fun ones, though.\n\nLewis: They are the most fun ones. But you always have that pang of anxiety when you realize you only have about $10 in your wallet.\n\nLapera: Which is OK, because most of the times those bars are also the cheapest in D.C., which is a hard thing to find. If listeners are ever in D.C., I have a couple recommendations for cheap bars. Something that's few and far between in D.C., for sure.\n\nLewis: Yeah, definitely. I think, one of the reasons I thought this conversation was so interesting is, when you think about big tech companies coming into a space like payments, this is something we also see in driverless cars, getting into what we think of as manufacturing, which is typically something that tech would stay away from. You think about them coming and disrupting and possibly unseating the industry incumbents. From this talk, it sounded to me like there's just so much in the way for them to do that, and they have almost zero interest in doing it. And a lot of the tone that I got was, \"We're looking more for cooperative efforts, and a little bit less for competitive efforts.\"\n\nLapera: Which makes a lot of sense. It's really interesting, because Visa especially is trying to break into this electronic wallet space. And they're having some success, but not as much as, say, Apple Pay has had, or Venmo, or any of those already-online wallets. So, there are payment processors that are looking to team up with tech companies like Apple. Apple doesn't actually do any of the payment processing. They are teamed up with Visa and Mastercard in order to do the payments.\n\nLewis: Which really makes sense for them as a company. This is a point Kahina raised in the conversation, we think about what goes into payment processing. You have risk, you have compliance, you have all of this regulatory stuff that you have to navigate. If you're a tech company and this is kind of far afield from your core competency, why would you want to take on all those pressures? Why wouldn't you just leave it to someone who knows what they're doing, have them handle things like authentication, managing fraud, chargebacks, all of that, and just enjoy enabling purchases that might not happen otherwise on top of their systems.\n\nLapera: Yeah. And that's something that I think, listeners, just in case you don't know, credit card companies like Visa and Mastercard, they're not actually responsible for holding on to your money or anything, they're just the middleman. They're the people who contact your bank and are like, \"Do they have enough money? What's their credit limit?\" And then they help do the transfer between the merchant and the bank. But they're not actually holding on to your money for you.\n\nLewis: Which is something that I don't think I knew. I don't know the financials space all that well, and frankly, there were elements of this where I was like, \"Huh, I didn't know that.\" But one of my big takeaways was, wow, the moat that these legacy financial companies have is massive, because no one wants to go into building out that type of infrastructure.\n\nLapera: Yeah. You want to hear some numbers?\n\nLewis: Absolutely.\n\nLapera: In 2015, which is the latest that I have data on in front of me, Visa had 50% of the U.S. credit card market share by network purchase volume, which is a lot. Mastercard is trailing around 25%. The debit card market share by network purchase volume, Visa has had a little dip, and now it's only at 70%. But it used to be at 80%. Mastercard is hovering around 30%. Market share based on number of credit cards in circulation at the end of 2015, Visa had 328 million credit cards in the U.S. circulating. Mastercard had 192 million. Which is crazy. The monthly purchase/spending volume at the end of 2015 on a Visa card is $341. For a MasterCard, it's $283. That's a lot of money, especially if you annualize that.\n\nLewis: Wow. One of the things I noticed with a lot of those numbers that you cited were that they were U.S.-focused. With some of these social platforms, as you might imagine, the most valuable markets are the U.S. market, the European market, so, the North American markets and the European markets. And then, some of the developing parts of the world are less valuable on a revenue-per-user basis. It sounds to me like that's the same thing for financials.\n\nLapera: Yeah, absolutely. Visa has actually just taken a big leg up on its competition by integrating Visa Europe, which, oddly enough, not part of Visa before this last quarter. They did that pretty flawlessly, when all things are considered. The metrics, the financial side of it, the accounting side of it, looks really good. And that's going to grow their business by 25% in one fell swoop. Isn't that crazy?\n\nLewis: Wow. One of the other things they touched on that plays into this regional conversation we're having is the idea that a lot of vendors are using Facebook in developing countries, and that's how they are creating an online presence. And then, they're using the peer-to-peer on Messenger as a way to facilitate transactions that aren't happening. I think, if there is a risk that you're looking for in any of this in the financials space, it's more in the developing markets, and maybe tech companies getting a foot in there and having that be the natural association that users have with payments, rather than traditional bank accounts, because a lot of folks in developing countries are unbanked at the moment. You probably know a little bit more about that than I do, Gaby.\n\nLapera: I know a lot about that, actually. If anyone wants a book recommendation, I have one for you.\n\nLewis: Yeah?\n\nLapera: Yeah. Lisa Servon, she actually came to Fool HQ a couple weeks ago, she wrote a book called The Unbanking Of America. Really interesting book about how the middle class is navigating being unbanked and underbanked in the United States. But a lot of those lessons can be applied to developing worlds, or developing nations.\n\nLewis: Is it a quick read?\n\nLapera: I thought so, but I also have a background in social sciences, so it was really fast for me. It's really interesting whenever I go on Amazon to look at book reviews, because half of them are always like, \"This book was way too technical,\" and I'm like, \"Great, I'll probably love this book.\" [laughs] So, if you're not into a lot of numbers, maybe not the book for you. But I thought it was great.\n\nLewis: I think that's the right way to qualify that recommendation.\n\nLapera: Yeah, that's totally fair. Before we get to our next topic, unless you have anything else to say about being unbanked?\n\nLewis: No, I think that wraps it for me. I think that's more your area of expertise. If you're ready to move on, I'm ready to move on.\n\nLapera: Peer-to-peer transfer, also known as P2P, just in case we accidentally abbreviate that at some point in the show, let's talk a little bit about that.\n\nLewis: Yeah, I thought that was another really interesting element of this conversation. One of the things that Kahina Van Dyke from Facebook said was, Facebook is not looking to make any money off of the P2P side of money transfer. A direct quote here was, \"We offer P2P for free, but it does cost money.\" What she really means there is, they're offering this, and the whole point is, \"We're going to eat these costs because we think it's really great for engagement on our apps and on our platform. We're happy to do that if it keeps people in the system longer.\"\n\nLapera: Yeah. That makes a lot of sense. But, that's actually a really interesting point about collecting data. I don't know how many of our listeners are familiar with Venmo. They're owned by PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL) now. They have this social feed that you can scroll through and see what all of your friends have been buying. So it could say, \"Dylan Lewis paid Gaby Lapera for 50 pineapple upside down cakes.\"\n\nLewis: A frequent purchase I make.\n\nLapera: Exactly. Dylan really likes pineapple. Actually, I don't know if you like pineapple, but I love pineapple, so maybe I would be paying you for pineapple upside down cake. [laughs] But, there's this really interesting aspect that sometimes people don't say exactly what they're actually using it for. There's actually this really sketchy feed called Vicemo, where these people have a scraper that goes through the Venmo feed -- because you can see anyone's purchases on it -- and it takes out anything that has any references to drugs or ladies of the night or alcohol, any illicit or less-above-board activities, and it publishes them in a feed that you can just scroll through. But I don't think that many people are saying, \"Yes, I am actually purchasing cocaine.\" They might do it as a joke, but I don't think it's real.\n\nLewis: Yeah, it's certainly entertaining. I think one of the things that highlights, and I am a Venmo user, and I do the same thing, I mess around with my friends, knowing that my payments are going to be public, and will often obscure whatever it is that I'm actually paying them for with a funny emoji instead. That kind of puts a ceiling on how helpful the data is that they're collecting on that messaging, and really understanding what people are using the platform to pay for.\n\nLapera: Yeah, definitely. I think the other thing that's really interesting about Venmo is that the adoption process, and other social commerce platforms, the adoption process has a hurdle in that a lot of people trust payment processors like Visa, or they trust their banks, but a lot of them have never heard of Venmo, or Facebook Messenger, as a way to transfer money. And they're like, \"Is that really secure? That's not really your area of expertise? Your area of expertise is Facebook, it's not money.\" So, I feel like a lot of potential users might hesitate to hop on to the social commerce, fintech-type space.\n\nLewis: Yeah. For as much as I enjoy messing around in the social space, and hanging out on digital media, I will not be giving Facebook my payment information. On my end, I'm happy to have one less point of access to my financial accounts.\n\nLapera: Yeah, definitely. That's something to keep in mind. And one of the really interesting things about Visa is that it's one of the most recognized brands in the world, and also one of the most trusted brands. And while Facebook might be one of the most recognized brands as well, I don't know that it's one of the most trusted, too.\n\nLewis: Yeah. There was a great quote from the panel. One of the people on it said, \"People may not like their banks, but they trust them.\" I think when you're talking about financial services, that's really what it comes down to. You want your money to still be there a week later. You don't want to have to worry about someone logging in and liquidating your accounts because you're constantly signed in to Messenger on your phone, or something like that. The authentication that it takes for me to get into my online bank account, there's a lot more hurdles there than it takes for me to log into Facebook on my iPhone.\n\nLapera: Yeah, which is one more argument for these tech companies using other parties that are already established to help them set up these networks. The other thing that's really interesting is that a lot of these things have not been monetized yet.\n\nLewis: Yeah. And they are backed by big tech money. Facebook saying, \"We're offering P2P for free,\" and it is, in some ways, a loss leader, or, it's a way to keep people playing on the platform, that echoes what Sheryl Sandberg has said in the past, one of their executives, basically saying that it's a way for them to enforce the activities that they want to see on Facebook and Instagram. It's not a means to an end in terms of profitability for them.\n\nLapera: They just want to see more people using their products.\n\nLewis: Exactly. And that's great for consumers. It's awesome for me to be able to send you money for free and not have to worry about it. But I think it does make the space a little bit tougher for your small players, maybe some of your upstarts.\n\nLapera: Yeah, definitely. I think Venmo is also free for P2P transfer. That's actually how I pay my rent. Fun fact, I told my landlords about it and they were 100% on board. They used to use PayPal, but they charged a processing fee. Venmo is free, as long as you're not paying via credit card. If you pay via credit card, there's a 3% surcharge. But as far as I know, that's the only way they're making money right now, and they're still not in the black.\n\nLewis: And they are, of course, part of PayPal, which is a large payment facilitation company. They're able to get away with fueling growth, fueling growth with the Venmo platform because they have this underlying business that is really firing on all cylinders. Ditto for Facebook. They have this huge ad business that just prints money, so they don't care what goes on with the payments on Messenger, because it's such an inconsequential amount of money for them. When you have that kind of backing, and you can have these loss leader services, it makes it a lot tougher for those new entrants, like I talked about. What you need to do and what you need to be able to offer is going to be eating into your bottom line for a long time just so that you can acquire customers.\n\nLapera: Yeah, definitely. I think this is going to be a really interesting space to watch going forward, and definitely something we will continue to cover at Industry Focus: Financials. Dylan, I want to thank you so much for joining us today.\n\nLewis: Thank you for having me. This was fun. I still have questions. There will be follow-up episodes where Dylan asks Gaby questions about financials because he doesn't understand the segment.\n\nLapera: I would love that. I think we should do all the crossover episodes ever. I have the most fun with those episodes.\n\nLewis: Hint hint, listeners, that might be another theme week coming up soon.\n\nLapera: As usual, people on the program may have interests in the stocks they talk about, and The Motley Fool may have formal recommendations for or against, so don't buy or sell stocks based solely on what you hear. Contact us at industryfocus@fool.com, or by tweeting us @MFIndustryFocus. Dylan, thank you again for joining us from South by Southwest. I hope your flight back is a lot better.\n\n\n\nLewis: Yeah, me too. [laughs] We'll see. Hopefully Saturday, smooth sailing.\n\n\n\nLapera: And, thank you very much to Austin, the man that the City of Austin is named after, where South by Southwest is taking place. He is today's producer. And thank you to you all for joining us. Everyone, have a great week!</p>"}}, {"media": {"url": "", "caption": "Score Analyse", "credit": "<a href = \"http://news.google.com/news/url?sa=T&ct2=us&fd=S&url=http://usacommercedaily.com/2017/03/22/where-american-express-company-axp-is-sitting-on-the-technical-charts-2/&cid=52779436026353&ei=4g3WWIHYNs-iuASgwIKYBg&usg=AFQjCNEpCvwkcWYPt5TqkFabfmkcH9NXlw\">USA Commerce Daily</a>"}, "start_date": {"hour": 12, "month": 3, "second": 0, "year": 2017, "day": 22, "minute": 0}, "end_date": {}, "text": {"headline": "\nWhere American Express Company (AXP) is sitting on the technical\u00a0charts?\n", "text": "<p>With all other things going on, American Express Company (NYSE:AXP) has been on a run \u2014 rising 3.81 percent in just three months. It looks like traders are happy with the stock. On the other side, analysts now consider American Express Company a neutral, and a technical analysis of the stock is setting somewhat neutral outlook for now.\n\nLet\u2019s talk about the gap between analyst price targets for the next 12 months and American Express Company (AXP)\u2018s current share price. Normally this spread should be in positive territory, indicating that analysts expect an investment\u2019s value to increase over time. So is with American Express Company. The median target of analyst views collected by Yahoo Finance was as much as $5.47 below AXP\u2019s recent stock price. That\u2019s the optimistic view from Wall Street.\n\nThe stock has actually made strong gains in the past year, as the company has gathered a 29.11% return in the past twelve months. But even with this move, there is still plenty of room for the company to come back from a longer term perspective, and especially if we look to recent lows for the company as well.\n\nThe company\u2019s share price is down -5.77% from previous highs of around $82 per share on March 01, 2017. On the bright side, the company\u2019s share price has been on the rebound, up more than 45.23% since hitting lows of $57.15 on June 28, 2016.\n\nFinally, from a technical perspective, there\u2019s a strong possibility that the stock could enter into a new bull market after finding strong support between $76.18 and $76.86. In terms of pullbacks, $78.67 level is the first resistance point. Technical analysis can help recognize key technical price levels in the stock. Investors can use these support and resistance levels to refine their entries and exits from stocks.\n\nAmerican Express Company (NYSE:AXP) price is pointing towards neither exit nor entry barriers, according to a technical analysis tool called the Relative Strength Index (RSI). Last session American Express Company RSI was seen at 38.94. RSI measures the speed and change of a stock price to warn investors when a stock\u2019s momentum has carried it too far. An RSI reading above 80 indicates that a stock is overbought while anything below 20 is oversold.\n\nWith these kinds of figures it is worthy to note that American Express Company (AXP) has been put into a neutral territory, but there are few other spots to consider. The Stochastic %K for AXP is 6.63. Stochastics is a momentum indicator that uses basic support and resistance levels and integrates with the trend to give accurate buy or sell signals to traders. For stochastics, readings below 20 are considered oversold and you would only take buy signals if the indicator is below that level. A value of 80 is considered overbought and sell signals occurring below that level would be ignored. This leads to longer trades and should result in fewer losses.\u201d)\n\n14-day Williams %R for American Express Company (NYSE:AXP) moved to around 95.16. The interpretation of Williams %R is very similar to that of the stochastic oscillator, except that the stochastic oscillator has internal smoothing. The oscillator ranges from 0 to -100. No matter how fast a security advances or declines, Williams %R will always fluctuate within this range. Overbought and oversold levels can be used to identify unsustainable price extremes. Simply put, readings in the range of 80% to 100% indicate that the security is oversold while readings in the 0% to 20% range suggest it is overbought.</p>"}}, {"media": {"url": "", "caption": "Score Analyse", "credit": "<a href = \"http://news.google.com/news/url?sa=T&ct2=us&fd=S&url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-03-22/dean-foods-davis-exposes-seedy-side-in-insider-trial-testimony&cid=52779433679666&ei=4g3WWIHYNs-iuASgwIKYBg&usg=AFQjCNEsjRDvFnOLQfFoLRCFMNkEbFKpVw\">Bloomberg</a>"}, "start_date": {"hour": 12, "month": 3, "second": 0, "year": 2017, "day": 22, "minute": 0}, "end_date": {}, "text": {"headline": "\nDean Foods Davis Tells Insider Jury of Prostitutes,\u00a0Gambling\n", "text": "<p>Former chairman says he was \u2018Enamored\u2019 with Billy Walters\n\nBlackjack, patronizing prostitutes and stealing from a charity for women and children. Those were some of the vices the U.S. government\u2019s star witness admitted to during testimony in the inside-trading trial of Las Vegas gambler Billy Walters.\n\nTom C. Davis, the former chairman of Dean Foods Co., also told a Manhattan jury he was enamored with Walters, who introduced him to pro golfer Phil Mickelson and was friends with investor Carl Icahn.\n\nEven after Walters arranged a $625,000 loan in 2010 for him, Davis said his failed investments, soaring expenses and a $200,000 casino debt forced him to siphon $100,000 from a golf charity that raised money for battered women. Davis repaid the money, but said he then \"double-dipped\" and withdrew $50,000 from the charity\u2019s account to gamble and pay for hookers.\n\n\u201cI made a very poor decision at that period of time in my life,\u201d a chagrined Davis said in his gravelly Texas drawl.\n\nDavis, 68, made the admissions under questioning by U.S. Assistant Attorney Brooke Cucinella. It\u2019s standard for a witness to disclose unsavory background information up front, rather than be forced to admit to it while questioned by a defense attorney. In that case, it might appear to a jury that the witness was trying to hide something.\n\nWalters, 70, is on trial, accused by the U.S. of reaping illegal profits over six years based on boardroom secrets Davis passed to him. Walters made $43 million, including $17.1 million on a lucrative tip about a spin-off of a Dean Foods unit in 2012, according to prosecutors.\n\nRepaid Charity\n\nDavis said he was authorized to draw from the charity account to pay expenses, food and gifts for the Pro-Am golf tournament he organized for the Dallas shelter. He said he repaid the charity in 2015, after having denied taking the money while being questioned under oath by officials from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.\n\nThe most important market news of the day. Get our markets daily newsletter.\n\nDavis said he blew the $625,000 he got through Walters, including losing $200,000 on one hand of blackjack at the Cosmopolitan of Las Vegas in 2011. Davis then sought out Walters for a second loan of $400,000, telling him it was to refinance a Dallas bank. Even though he\u2019d stopped making payments on the first loan, Davis said Walters agreed. He said he didn\u2019t tell Walters the real reason for the loan was \"because I was embarrassed.\"\n\nAsked if he had a gambling problem, Davis insisted he didn\u2019t. He told jurors he liked to regularly bet thousands of dollars on college and NFL football games. The most he said he ever lost on sports was $20,000 on a Super Bowl game, he said.\n\nFalse Pretenses\n\nWalters\u2019s lawyer, Barry Berke, told jurors in opening statements last week that Davis was a liar who embezzled the $400,000 on false pretenses without ever investing the funds.\n\nCucinella asked Davis why he\u2019d been giving inside information to Walters long before he got the 2010 loan.\n\n\"I\u2019d developed a strong friendship with Mr. Walters,\" Davis said. \"I knew who Billy Walters was -- he was a fairly famous gambler. He had a lot of connections in Las Vegas. He was a big sports gambler. I was frankly enamored with him.\"\n\nDavis was also impressed with the company which Walters kept. Walters introduced him to Mickelson, who was a member of the same country club in Southern California as Walters.\n\nIcahn Connection\n\nDavis said Walters also passed on a stock tip to him, saying \u201cmy friend in New York likes this company a lot. You should look at it and you should think about buying the stock.\u201d\n\nCucinella asked Davis who Walters\u2019s friend was, to which Davis replied, \"Carl Icahn. He told me he had a good relationship, a close relationship with Mr. Icahn. I recall him saying he actually traveled with him before.\"\n\nDavis didn\u2019t say when Walters gave him the tip or what company it pertained to.\n\nA spokeswoman for Icahn didn\u2019t immediately respond to a request for comment on Davis\u2019s testimony.\n\nDavis testified that Walters gave him a disposable phone, nicknamed the \"Bat Phone,\" to use when passing tips about Dean Foods and said he tossed it into a creek behind his Dallas home after the FBI visited him 2014. During cross-examination Wednesday, Berke suggested Davis made up the story.\n\nDavis had his own reasons for using a disposable phone -- because he \"had a history of infidelity\" and was trying to hide his frequent calls to escort services from his soon-to-be ex-wife, Terie Davis, Berke said.\n\nBerke confronted Davis with his telephone records and his American Express bills that showed dozens of calls and charges were made to escort services, including when he was in Colorado for a Dean Foods board of directors meeting.\n\n\"Do you recall sir, that while you were on a business trip that you called an escort service?\" Berke asked.\n\n\"I see that,\" Davis replied. \"I don\u2019t recall ever paying for sex.\"\n\nThe case is U.S. v. Walters, 16-cr-338, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan).</p>"}}, {"media": {"url": "", "caption": "Score Analyse", "credit": "<a href = \"http://news.google.com/news/url?sa=T&ct2=us&fd=S&url=https://buckeyebusinessreview.com/2017/03/22/how-do-the-margins-look-for-american-express-company-nyseaxp/&cid=52779433266704&ei=4g3WWIHYNs-iuASgwIKYBg&usg=AFQjCNHIinvmvvqDII-HRaVqKk5k7-5VgA\">Buckeye Business Review</a>"}, "start_date": {"hour": 12, "month": 3, "second": 0, "year": 2017, "day": 22, "minute": 0}, "end_date": {}, "text": {"headline": "\nHow Do The Margins Look For American Express Company\u00a0(NYSE:AXP)?\n", "text": "<p>How Do The Margins Look For American Express Company (NYSE:AXP)?\n\nInvestors may be interested in viewing the Gross Margin score on shares of American Express Company (NYSE:AXP). The name currently has a score of 9.00000. This score is derived from the Gross Margin (Marx) stability and growth over the previous eight years. The Gross Margin score lands on a scale from 1 to 100 where a score of 1 would be considered positive, and a score of 100 would be seen as negative. The low score of 9.00000 for American Express Company indicates a top score for stability and growth.\n\nChecking in on some valuation rankings, American Express Company (NYSE:AXP) has a Value Composite score of 56. Developed by James O\u2019Shaughnessy, the VC score uses five valuation ratios. These ratios are price to earnings, price to cash flow, EBITDA to EV, price to book value, and price to sales. The VC is displayed as a number between 1 and 100. In general, a company with a score closer to 0 would be seen as undervalued, and a score closer to 100 would indicate an overvalued company. Adding a sixth ratio, shareholder yield, we can view the Value Composite 2 score which is currently sitting at 43.\n\nAfter a recent scan, we can see that American Express Company (NYSE:AXP) has a Shareholder Yield of 0.086604 and a Shareholder Yield (Mebane Faber) of 0.05535. The first value is calculated by adding the dividend yield to the percentage of repurchased shares. The second value adds in the net debt repaid yield to the calculation. Shareholder yield has the ability to show how much money the firm is giving back to shareholders via a few different avenues. Companies may issue new shares and buy back their own shares. This may occur at the same time. Investors may also use shareholder yield to gauge a baseline rate of return.\n\nAt the time of writing, American Express Company (NYSE:AXP) has a Piotroski F-Score of 5. The F-Score may help discover companies with strengthening balance sheets. The score may also be used to spot the weak performers. Joseph Piotroski developed the F-Score which employs nine different variables based on the company financial statement. A single point is assigned to each test that a stock passes. Typically, a stock scoring an 8 or 9 would be seen as strong. On the other end, a stock with a score from 0-2 would be viewed as weak.\n\nAmerican Express Company (NYSE:AXP) has a current ERP5 Rank of 7531 . The ERP5 Rank may assist investors with spotting companies that are undervalued. This ranking uses four ratios. These ratios are Earnings Yield, ROIC, Price to Book, and 5 year average ROIC. When looking at the ERP5 ranking, it is generally considered the lower the value, the better.\n\nShifting gears, we can see that American Express Company (NYSE:AXP) has a Q.i. Value of 61.00000. The Q.i. Value ranks companies using four ratios. These ratios consist of EBITDA Yield, FCF Yield, Liquidity, and Earnings Yield. The purpose of the Q.i. Value is to help identify companies that are the most undervalued. Typically, the lower the value, the more undervalued the company tends to be.</p>"}}, {"media": {"url": "", "caption": "Score Analyse", "credit": "<a href = \"http://news.google.com/news/url?sa=T&ct2=us&fd=S&url=http://indianexpress.com/article/technology/tech-news-technology/samsung-pay-to-launch-in-india-today-all-you-need-to-know/&cid=52779429730081&ei=4g3WWIHYNs-iuASgwIKYBg&usg=AFQjCNEnLIKqtzTUlvNEA4kfXlL4OKsjAw\">The Indian Express</a>"}, "start_date": {"hour": 12, "month": 3, "second": 0, "year": 2017, "day": 22, "minute": 0}, "end_date": {}, "text": {"headline": "\nSamsung Pay in India, supports Credit, Debits cards and digital\u00a0wallets\n", "text": "<p>Samsung Pay uses both NFC and MST (magnetic secure transmission) to make wireless payments. Samsung Pay uses both NFC and MST (magnetic secure transmission) to make wireless payments.\n\nSamsung has launched its mobile payment service, Samsung Pay, in India today. Samsung Pay will be available across the flagship Galaxy smartphones for now which includes the Galaxy Note 5, Galaxy S7, Galaxy S7 edge, Galaxy S6 edge+, Galaxy A7 (2016) and Galaxy A5 (2016), Galaxy A7 (2017) and Galaxy A5 (2017). Plus, the Gear S3 will also support Samsung Pay.\n\nSamsung has tied up with several banks and payment gateways in India. The list includes ICICI Bank, HDFC Bank, SBI, Standard Chartered, Citi Bank, and American Express. Its network partners are American Express, Visa, and MasterCard, while Pine Labs is the Acceptance partner for PoS machines. Finally Samsung has also tied up with mobile wallet Paytm for payments, and will be adding UPIs support via Axis Bank in the coming months.\n\n\u201cThe idea is that everything is part of the smartphone. With Samsung Pay, your debit cards, credit cards, mobile wallets will all be in one place. We have always supported Make in India, and with Samsung Pay we are doing meaningful innovation in India. We have worked closely with banks, payment gateways, card companies, and even mobile wallets in India,\u201d said HC Hong, who is President and CEO of Samsung Electronics SouthWest Asia.\n\n\u201cWhen we studied attitudes towards mobile payments in India, we found some barriers in acceptance among the consumers. The barriers were around security, ease of use and acceptance. With Samsung Pay, we\u2019ve tried to overcome most of these issues,\u201d said Asim Warsi, Senior Vice President at Samsung India.\n\nWarsi pointed out that Samsung Pay uses three levels of authentication: One is fingerprint authentication for authorizing payment, two being Card Tokenization, and finally Samsung\u2019s own security feature called Samsung Knox. Samsung says it doesn\u2019t really store the actual credit card number, instead with Tokenization a token number is stored as a placeholder by the company.\n\nSamsung Pay will not require merchants to upgrade to a different PoS machine, any machine with MST technology will be compatible with the eligible Samsung devices. Samsung Pay uses NFC (Near Fields Communication) as well as MST (Magnetic Secure Transmission) to make wireless payments. So essentially a user can just hold their Samsung smartphone next to a PoS machine, and the choose the card or wallet they want to make a payment with, and it will be detected by the machine. After that, the user can type in the amount they need to pay, enter their final transaction PIN, which is still required as per RBI norms, and the payment will go through.\n\nSamsung becomes the first company to launch a mobile payment service in India, ahead of Apple Pay or Android Pay. However, the service is still limited to a select few Galaxy smartphones, and we\u2019ll have to wait, and see how soon it is rolled out to other devices.\n\nFor all the latest Tech News, download Indian Express App now\n\n\u00a9 IE Online Media Services Pvt Ltd</p>"}}, {"media": {"url": "", "caption": "Score Analyse", "credit": "<a href = \"http://news.google.com/news/url?sa=T&ct2=us&fd=S&url=http://www.businesstravelnews.com/Procurement/Amex-Increases-CEOs-2016-Pay&cid=0&ei=4g3WWIHYNs-iuASgwIKYBg&usg=AFQjCNFcINXGcopWyvTi5M5ZwZ1Md_Rrfg\">Business Travel News</a>"}, "start_date": {"hour": 12, "month": 3, "second": 0, "year": 2017, "day": 22, "minute": 0}, "end_date": {}, "text": {"headline": "\nAmex Increases CEO's 2016\u00a0Pay\n", "text": "<p>Pardon Our Interruption...\n\nAs you were browsing http://www.businesstravelnews.com something about your browser made us think you were a bot.

Don't worry ... It's FREE!\n\nWe will never sell or rent your email address to anyone. We value your privacy. (We hate spam as much as you do.) See our privacy policy.\n\nVeteran filmmaker Vern Oakley knows how to use video to create a powerful connection with an audience. He directed short films, the feature film \"A Modern Affair,\" and even the popular television show \"Reading Rainbow.\"\n\nAs founder of Tribe Pictures, he brought his storytelling talent into the business realm, creating films for Fortune 500 companies, nonprofit organizations, universities, and their executives. He's worked with American Express, AT&T, Pfizer, Princeton, and many other clients from all sorts of industries.\n\nBy coaxing out the \"person\" behind the brand (or \"the soul behind the suit,\" as he's been known to call it), Vern helps brands to showcase their humanity and create a lasting connection with their audiences. Through video, he's helped companies communicate with potential investors, manage crises, recruit the best talent, and roll out new products and brands.\n\nI invited Vern to Marketing Smarts to discuss his book, Leadership in Focus: Bringing Out Your Best on Camera, and to offer valuable tips for marketers who want to take advantage of the unparalleled power of video to connect brands with their audiences.\n\nHere are just a few highlights from my conversation with Vern:\n\n\n\n\n\nTell your origin story \"warts and all\"\u2014don't leave out the conflict (03:25): \"Storytelling is so different in the corporate arena because some of the really great ways that we tell stories in the entertainment business are kind of moved to the side when you're working in corporate America. For example, corporations don't always like to look down the center when they're talking about a conflict, which is the essence of good drama. They like to take the story from 'we're doing good and we're getting better and we're going to get even better,' as opposed to 'oh boy, we really had a huge problem and we really had to overcome something.' That's why sometimes the origin stories of companies are just so fascinating, because that's when the founders are trying to do something and nothing was going right and they had to figure out something that was just incredibly different. That makes for a really powerful story, much like the entertainment stories we have in television and Hollywood.\"\n\nMost B2B business problems are actually human problems, and human problems make good stories (04:08): \"When you think about what we do in terms of telling stories for the Fortune 500, stories really collectively build up to a brand. What's interesting about these kinds of stories is that they're really human stories. Most business problems, when you get down to analyzing it, are really human problems. How do we get the right people? How do we communicate the vision? What markets are we going to enter? All those have a human component, and if we can find the human beings that actually can express these key messages, and let their passion, their authenticity, their hopes and dreams come through in the business world, we actually can make films which are...interesting and exciting and that people want to share.\"\n\nBefore you create a video (or any piece of content), define how you'll measure success (18:39): \"So much depends upon which department you're working in, but in terms of Human Resources, if we're making recruiting films, you want more people to be applying for the jobs and you want more qualified candidates to be applying for the job. In terms of investor relations, you really are hoping that people start to understand a more comprehensive story of the company. These things can be measured if you set up the metrics properly. Not everyone has the time, energy, and money to devote to that, but when you take the surveys as to attitudes prior to watching the video and attitudes after watching the video, sometimes since you don't always do that, you can talk about the number of views.... Sometimes the return on investment is just that your CEO loves the video.\"\n\nTo learn more, visit VernOakley.com or TribePIctures.com, or follow Vern on Twitter at @VernOakley, and be sure to get your copy of Leadership in Focus: Bringing Out Your Best on Camera.\n\nVern and I talked about much more, including getting executives to invest in video content, and the anatomy of an effective video, so be sure to listen to the entire show, which you can do above, or download the mp3 and listen at your convenience.
