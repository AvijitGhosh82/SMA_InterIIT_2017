A \u201cBuy\u201d rating does not mean that every investor should acquire the stock. Nor does a \u201cSell\u201d rating mean that every investor should immediately sell it. Your own financial situation and investment needs are what matter.

In short, whatever a given analyst recommendation may say, always consider whether a particular investment is right for you in light of your own financial circumstances. Remember, you are the boss, it\u2019s your money, and your situation and goals that matter.</p>"}}, {"media": {"url": "", "caption": "Score Analyse", "credit": "<a href = \"http://news.google.com/news/url?sa=T&ct2=us&fd=S&url=http://www.nasdaq.com/article/buzzus-stocks-on-the-movenike-sears-therapix-frontier-snap-transdigm--xcel-brands-20170322-00944&cid=52779433060425&ei=FvfVWJnFEJj4uASX3ryoDg&usg=AFQjCNHNiC-9Y7RKUUQfMTk4c6Nds9NG3g\">Nasdaq</a>"}, "start_date": {"hour": 12, "month": 3, "second": 0, "year": 2017, "day": 22, "minute": 0}, "end_date": {}, "text": {"headline": "\nBUZZ-US STOCKS ON THE MOVE-Nike, Sears, Therapix, Frontier, Snap, TransDigm\u00a0...\n", "text": "<p>Reuters\n\n\n\n\n\n* Eikon search string for individual stock moves: STXBZ * The Day Ahead newsletter: http://tmsnrt.rs/2ggOmBi * The Morning News Call newsletter: http://tmsnrt.rs/2fwPLTh The S&P and the Nasdaq reversed course to hit session highs in late morning trading on Wednesday, even as investors remained cautious ahead of the first major legislative test of Donald Trump's presidency.
