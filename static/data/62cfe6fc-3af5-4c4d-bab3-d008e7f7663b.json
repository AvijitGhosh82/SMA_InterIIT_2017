I. du Pont de Nemours and Company (NYSE:DD) has been on a run \u2014 rising 7.07 percent in just three months. It looks like traders are happy with the stock. On the other side, analysts now consider E. I. du Pont de Nemours and Company a neutral, and a technical analysis of the stock is setting somewhat neutral outlook for now.\n\nLet\u2019s talk about the gap between analyst price targets for the next 12 months and E. I. du Pont de Nemours and Company (DD)\u2018s current share price. Normally this spread should be in positive territory, indicating that analysts expect an investment\u2019s value to increase over time. So is with E. I. du Pont de Nemours and Company. The median target of analyst views collected by Yahoo Finance was as much as $5.24 below DD\u2019s recent stock price. That\u2019s the optimistic view from Wall Street.\n\nThe stock has actually made strong gains in the past year, as the company has gathered a 26.24% return in the past twelve months. But even with this move, there is still plenty of room for the company to come back from a longer term perspective, and especially if we look to recent lows for the company as well.\n\nThe company\u2019s share price is down -2.63% from previous highs of around $81.86 per share on March 20, 2017. On the bright side, the company\u2019s share price has been on the rebound, up more than 39.07% since hitting lows of $61.12 on July 06, 2016.\n\nFinally, from a technical perspective, there\u2019s a strong possibility that the stock could enter into a new bull market after finding strong support between $78.11 and $78.94. In terms of pullbacks, $81.21 level is the first resistance point. Technical analysis can help recognize key technical price levels in the stock. Investors can use these support and resistance levels to refine their entries and exits from stocks.\n\nE. I. du Pont de Nemours and Company (NYSE:DD) price is pointing towards neither exit nor entry barriers, according to a technical analysis tool called the Relative Strength Index (RSI). Last session E. I. du Pont de Nemours and Company RSI was seen at 53.79. RSI measures the speed and change of a stock price to warn investors when a stock\u2019s momentum has carried it too far. An RSI reading above 80 indicates that a stock is overbought while anything below 20 is oversold.\n\nWith these kinds of figures it is worthy to note that E. I. du Pont de Nemours and Company (DD) has been put into a neutral territory, but there are few other spots to consider. The Stochastic %K for DD is 67.81. Stochastics is a momentum indicator that uses basic support and resistance levels and integrates with the trend to give accurate buy or sell signals to traders. For stochastics, readings below 20 are considered oversold and you would only take buy signals if the indicator is below that level. A value of 80 is considered overbought and sell signals occurring below that level would be ignored. This leads to longer trades and should result in fewer losses.\u201d)\n\n14-day Williams %R for E. I. du Pont de Nemours and Company (NYSE:DD) moved to around 75. The interpretation of Williams %R is very similar to that of the stochastic oscillator, except that the stochastic oscillator has internal smoothing. The oscillator ranges from 0 to -100. No matter how fast a security advances or declines, Williams %R will always fluctuate within this range. Overbought and oversold levels can be used to identify unsustainable price extremes. Simply put, readings in the range of 80% to 100% indicate that the security is oversold while readings in the 0% to 20% range suggest it is overbought.</p>"}}, {"media": {"url": "", "caption": "Score Analyse", "credit": "<a href = \"http://news.google.com/news/url?sa=T&ct2=us&fd=S&url=https://www.benchmarkmonitor.com/after-hours-laggards-nike-inc-nysenke-e-i-du-pont-de-nemours-and-company-nysedd-concho-resources-inc-nysecxo/197229&cid=52779431432985&ei=bB7WWLnwDIGquASe6pXoBQ&usg=AFQjCNFLv8N02IUSAESlBWuAyMAZ6LF57Q\">Benchmark Monitor</a>"}, "start_date": {"hour": 12, "month": 3, "second": 0, "year": 2017, "day": 22, "minute": 0}, "end_date": {}, "text": {"headline": "\nAfter-Hours Laggards: NIKE, Inc.

I. du Pont de Nemours and Company (DD), and see some interesting trends in the stock\u2019s behavior of late. They say the \u201csoul\u201d of a stock is best known by an examination of its behavior on the tape. With that in mind, consider how this stock has been acting as a clue to where it may be headed going forward.\n\nDD has been trading in a bearish trend, based on the relative levels of its 50-day and 200-day simple moving averages. This suggests that the broad sum of capital flow in the stock has been generally negative over the recent period. In terms of the relative level of interest afforded this stock among active participants in the market, relative volume measures have been strong, indicating enthusiasm for the name by traders, investors, and money managers during the past month of action. This suggests something of the significance of other current technical measures as well.\n\nFor market timers, it\u2019s also important to take measure of the relative level of recent lift or pressure in the stock is it overbought or oversold? For that, we turn to RSI and stochastic measures. The 14-day RSI stands at 52.05%. That shows that the stock, according to a traditional interpretation and usage of the RSI indicator, is not particularly predisposed to a reactive price movement based on this measure If we look at the stochastic measure, the raw data over the stock\u2019s last month of action shows a score of 81.13%. Based on a raw data interpretation, the stock is relatively overbought from this perspective.\n\nIt should be noted that the overall volatility in the stock is worth gauging as well. In recent action, DD has made a move of +2.58 over the past month. Over the trailing year, the stock is outperforming the S&P 500 by 6.99%, and it\u2019s gotten there by action that has been more volatile on a day-to-day basis than most other stocks on the exchange. The stock\u2019s recent movement has come on a historical volatility score of 17.85%, which represents the standard deviation of returns of a theoretical long position from a mean price during that period. On a daily basis over the past month, the average true range of the stock, as expressed in percentage terms, is 1.4%. That should give you a pretty good sense of the level of risk implied in a short-term trading approach in the stock with a stop-loss in place.\n\nAs it stands at present, the stock might find important action at key Fibonacci levels. Fibonacci levels are used by major Wall Street firm technical desks. The math is drawn from the Fibonacci series that defines growth systems by an interval increase characterized by steps divisible by the \u201cgolden ratio\u201d of 61.8%. In this case, the critical 38.2% level drawn off the 52-weeklow of $60.16 sits at $68.45. DD also has additional support below at the stock\u2019s 200-day simple moving average, which sits at $71.29.</p>"}}, {"media": {"url": "", "caption": "Score Analyse", "credit": "<a href = \"http://news.google.com/news/url?sa=T&ct2=us&fd=S&url=http://www.benchmarkmonitor.com/healthequity-inc-nasdaqhqy-reported-q4-net-income-of-4-1-million/197281&cid=52779427262687&ei=bB7WWLnwDIGquASe6pXoBQ&usg=AFQjCNHjLAsKwsq86h81ak2ymHwRyqkD9w\">Benchmark Monitor</a>"}, "start_date": {"hour": 12, "month": 3, "second": 0, "year": 2017, "day": 22, "minute": 0}, "end_date": {}, "text": {"headline": "\nHealthEquity, Inc.

Sales climbed 14 percent to $13 billion, Midland, Michigan-based Dow said Thursday in a statement. That compared with the $12.4 billion that analysts anticipated.\n\nDow paid Corning Inc. $4.8 billion to gain complete control of their 72-year-old silicones venture in June, boosting results in the consumer and infrastructure solutions businesses. That helped make up for lower earnings from plastics, Dow\u2019s largest business. Operating profit surged 83 percent in the consumer solutions unit, which serves automotive, electronics, food, pharmaceutical and personal care markets.\n\n\u201cConsumer-focused businesses have been really good for Dow, offsetting soft industrial end-markets,\u201d James Sheehan, an analyst at Suntrust Robinson Humphrey Inc., said by telephone before the results were announced.\n\nExcluding acquisitions, total sales volume rose 3 percent, led by a 7 percent gain in consumer solutions, Dow said. Prices on average were little changed.\n\n\u2018Early Signs\u2019\n\n\u201cWe are seeing early signs of positive economic momentum, with the United States in expansionary mode, driven by the ongoing strength of the consumer and the tailwind of a new incoming administration promising structural reforms,\u201d Chief Executive Officer Andrew Liveris said in the statement.\n\nLiveris this week met with President Donald Trump at the White House along with other company executives to discuss ways to boost U.S. manufacturing employment. Liveris previously advised President Barack Obama.\n\nEurope\u2019s economy is continuing to make a gradual recovery while Asia\u2019s middle class is driving demand in that region, the CEO said. Dow also is seeing improvement in Latin America, including in Brazil, he said.\n\nLiveris is eliminating 2,500 jobs in a cost-saving push related to the Dow Corning acquisition. He\u2019s shedding commodity assets such as chlorine while adding higher-value products such as silicone, used in tires and electronics. Construction of a new ethylene plant in Texas is more than 90 percent finished and all 26 units at the Sadara joint venture in Saudi Arabia are complete, Dow said in the statement.\n\nBuffett\u2019s Holding\n\nDow in December eliminated $340 million of annual preferred dividend payments by converting shares held by Warren Buffett\u2019s Berkshire Hathaway Inc. and the Kuwait Investment Authority into common stock. That also had the effect of diluting the company\u2019s per-share earnings.\n\nBased on generally accepted accounting principles, Dow posted a fourth-quarter net loss of 3 cents a share because of a $1.1 billion expense related to changes in asbestos liability accounting and $295 million for the cleanup of environmental sites.\n\nThe asbestos charge stems from a decision to accrue projected legal fees and anticipated settlement costs through 2049, Chief Financial Officer Howard Ungerleider said. There is no change to the company\u2019s asbestos liability, he said. The environmental expense reflects remediation agreements with regulators for polluted, inactive Union Carbide and Rohm & Haas sites.\n\nMerger Concerns\n\nDow and DuPont announced their merger of equals in December 2015. This week they won a 10-day extension to satisfy European Union concerns that joining together the biggest U.S. chemical makers would hurt innovation, particularly the development of crop pesticides. The deal also needs approvals in the U.S., China and Brazil. DuPont CEO Ed Breen on Tuesday said the companies can remedy antitrust worries, although the extended EU negotiations mean they may not combine until mid-year, rather than in the first quarter.\n\nExclusive insights on technology around the world. Get Fully Charged, from Bloomberg Technology.\n\nThe merger partners plan to cut $3 billion in costs from DowDuPont, including $300 million from research and development spending. Reductions in R&D won\u2019t involve scientists who develop new products, Breen said this week. Eighteen months after closing, the new DowDuPont Inc. is to split into three publicly traded entities, including an agriculture company that would be larger than current market leaders Monsanto Co. and Syngenta AG, which have agreed to separate mergers.\n\nDuPont on Tuesday reported fourth-quarter earnings that exceeded analysts\u2019 projections amid cost cuts and increased sales of plastic auto parts and food ingredients.</p>"}}]}
