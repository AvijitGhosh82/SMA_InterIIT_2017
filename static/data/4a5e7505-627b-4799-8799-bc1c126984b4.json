(NFLX), Kinder Morgan Inc (KMI) and The Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS).\n\nNetflix shares have gained +42.7% over the past 12 months, outperforming the Zacks Broadcast Radio/TV industry, which has gained +23.3% over the same period. Netflix's focus on global expansion and original content has paid off with the streaming giant adding 7.05 million net new additions in the last reported quarter, taking the total count to 19 million for 2016. Moreover, for the first time, Netflix expects International segment to post profits in the current quarter to the tune of $16 million. But, investments in original/acquired content remain a drag on profitability. Netflix reports Q1 results on April 17th, with the company expected to earn 38 cents on $2.6 billion in revenues, up f rom 6 cents on $1.96 billion in revenues in the year-earlier period. (You can read the full research report on Netflix here >> )\n\nKinder Morgan, the owner and operator of the largest network of natural gas pipelines in North America, has moved past the worst in recent history when a debt-laden balance sheet and weaker commodity volumes in response to lower natural gas prices stretched its financials. The dividend cut and debt repayments have materially stabilized the company's financial profile and put it on track sustainable long-term growth. While near-term challenges remain, the company's strong position in natural gas infrastructure is a key long-term competitive advantage. The stock has lagged the Zacks Oil & gas Pipeline industry in the last one year, but has done better than the Energy sector as a whole.

Also, the company is poised to benefit from its disciplined expense management and solid capital position. However, several issues including sluggish global economic growth and a stringent regulatory landscape remain near-to-medium-term headwinds.

(GS) : Checking the\u00a0Chart\n", "text": "<p>We have gathered the technical data on The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (GS), and see some interesting trends in the stock\u2019s behavior of late. In the end, it\u2019s all about what a stock does that matters. In the case of this particular stock, the chart tells quite a story at present.\n\nGS has been trading in a bearish trend, based on the relative levels of its 50-day and 200-day simple moving averages. This suggests that the broad sum of capital flow in the stock has been generally negative over the recent period. In terms of the relative level of interest afforded this stock among active participants in the market, relative volume measures have been weak, indicating apathy for the name by traders, investors, and money managers during the past month of action. This suggests something of the significance of other current technical measures as well.\n\nFor market timers, it\u2019s also important to take measure of the relative level of recent lift or pressure in the stock is it overbought or oversold? For that, we turn to RSI and stochastic measures. The 14-day RSI stands at 28.41%. That shows that the stock, according to a traditional interpretation and usage of the RSI indicator, is becoming oversold or undervalued, and therefore may be ready for a trend change or corrective price reversal to the upside If we look at the stochastic measure, the raw data over the stock\u2019s last month of action shows a score of 2.07%. Based on a raw data interpretation, this perspective doesn\u2019t suggest either an overbought or oversold condition.\n\nAs professionals know, risk is best understood through a measure of volatility in an investment vehicle. In recent action, GS has made a move of -18.76 over the past month. Over the trailing year, the stock is outperforming the S&P 500 by 32.55%, and it\u2019s gotten there by action that has been more volatile on a day-to-day basis than most other stocks on the exchange. The stock\u2019s recent movement has come on a historical volatility score of 17.47%, which represents the standard deviation of returns of a theoretical long position from a mean price during that period. On a daily basis over the past month, the average true range of the stock, as expressed in percentage terms, is 1.7%. That should give you a pretty good sense of the level of risk implied in a short-term trading approach in the stock with a stop-loss in place.\n\nAs it stands at present, the stock might find important action at key Fibonacci levels. Fibonacci levels are used by major Wall Street firm technical desks. The math is drawn from the Fibonacci series that defines growth systems by an interval increase characterized by steps divisible by the \u201cgolden ratio\u201d of 61.8%. In this case, the critical 38.2% level drawn off the 52-weeklow of $136.88 sits at $182.06. GS also has additional support below at the stock\u2019s 200-day simple moving average, which sits at $195.75.</p>"}}, {"media": {"url": "", "caption": "Score Analyse", "credit": "<a href = \"http://news.google.com/news/url?sa=T&ct2=us&fd=S&url=https://www.thecerbatgem.com/2017/03/22/novartis-ag-nvs-receives-neutral-rating-from-goldman-sachs-group-inc.html&cid=52779426820045&ei=4g3WWKmkNZLYuASynZrgBg&usg=AFQjCNE3jg9Uzsi_qiaYigWZJdnvoTIXRg\">The Cerbat Gem</a>"}, "start_date": {"hour": 12, "month": 3, "second": 0, "year": 2017, "day": 22, "minute": 0}, "end_date": {}, "text": {"headline": "\nNovartis AG (NVS) Receives Neutral Rating from Goldman Sachs Group\u00a0Inc\n", "text": "<p>Novartis AG (NYSE:NVS)\u2018s stock had its \u201cneutral\u201d rating reaffirmed by analysts at Goldman Sachs Group Inc in a report issued on Wednesday.\n\nA number of other brokerages have also recently commented on NVS.

Pax withdrew the proposals after all five agreed to take steps to address pay inequities, though none committed to the specific requests to make public the data or to close the gaps.\n\n\u201cThis is a process,\u201d said Heather Smith, lead sustainability research analyst at Portsmouth, New Hampshire-based Pax. \u201cWe don\u2019t expect our work to stop here. We will be continuing our conversations with these and other companies.\u201d\n\nFollowing Pax\u2019s proposals, three of the companies -- Bank of New York Mellon Corp., Verizon Communications Inc. and Qualcomm Inc. -- released statements outlining their commitments to pay parity and explaining how they will monitor it. Goldman Sachs Group Inc. agreed to enhance pay equity disclosures in a report this spring, Smith said. Fletcher Cook, a spokesman for AT&T, said the company had signed the White House Equal Pay Pledge last year, reinforcing \u201cwhat we already deliver to our employees: equal pay for comparable work, experience and performance.\u201d\n\nOther finance companies are resisting similar pressure from Boston-based Arjuna Capital. At 2017 annual meetings, shareholders at Wells Fargo & Co., Citigroup Inc., American Express Co. and Bank of America Corp. will vote on measures asking the companies to issue reports examining gender-pay gaps and their efforts to ensure parity.\n\nAll four have advised investors to reject the proposals, arguing that they already have strong records on hiring, paying and promoting women. None make public any examination of gender-pay gaps or efforts to ensure pay parity, according to Natasha Lamb, managing director at Arjuna.\n\nThe most important business stories of the day. Get Bloomberg's daily newsletter.\n\nLamb said the companies she engaged with had offered similar responses to those Pax received, but Arjuna didn\u2019t withdraw its proposals. \u201cIt is not sufficient,\u201d she said. \u201cWe expect the same level of reporting as the tech companies gave in 2016. That means reporting the percentage gap and committing to close it.\u201d Last year, Arjuna made equal pay proposals at nine tech companies, seven of which -- including Intel Corp. and Apple Inc. -- agreed to make the data public and close the gaps.\n\nThe gender-pay gap has become an important metric for investors and others who are concerned about increasing opportunity for women in finance. While women represent about half of the workforce of the 23 banks with market capitalization of greater than $25 billion, they make up only about 21 percent of their executive ranks, according to Bloomberg data.\n\nThe finance industry also has one of the largest pay disparities, according to a survey by job site Glassdoor.com. Men who work at financial services firms on average earn 6.4 percent more than women, after controlling for job title and responsibilities. The gap at technology companies, for example, is 5.9 percent.</p>"}}]}
